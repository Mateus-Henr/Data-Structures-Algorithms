    Data Structure
    - Organizes and stores data.
    - Each one has advantages and disadvantages.
    - Depending on what you want to do one data structure might perform better than the others.


    Algorithm
    - It describes the steps that you have to achieve a result.
    - There is usually more than one algorithm to accomplish a task (the same for implementations).
    - An algorithm is not an implementation, it only describes the steps, but these words may be used interchangeably.
